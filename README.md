# ClockworkShortcuts
Shortcuts I made so you can play and I can create. I normally publish new shortcuts you can use when I am bored. The category of shortcuts I will be mostly making at this time are story/game shortcuts.

# IMPORTANT
Shortcuts is a native app for iOS and iPadOS. This means you cannot run these shortcuts if you have android or a computer system. Very sorry about that!

# TROUBLESHOOTING AND MY SERVER
Have any problems? Come to my server: (https://discord.gg/n8pgttWt) or pull up an issue and @MrWinterz98.

# How To Download My Releases
On the side, there should be a "Releases" tab. When you go to my releases, please click on the iCloud link and not assets. Assets is completely useless to me because you can only download/share shortcuts through links.
